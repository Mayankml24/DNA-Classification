# DNA Classification

Hi! In this tutorial, we will work on building and training our Machine Learning model using Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Process, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Net, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, SVM Linear, SVM RBF, and SVM Sigmoid in order to compare accuracy in different models.     
    
For a better understanding, I would recommend going through the below links before starting the tutorial:
